# Johnny-Five servo clock
**A firmware project using ***nodejs*** to implement a servo motor clock**

*Artwork by [Ryan](https://github.com/4D616B6572)*

this project is just for fun, cause i really want to try build something based on node bot, and i think *node clock* may be a good choice.
### Schedule
1. build one digit **(done!!)**
2. build the whole clock (include four digits)

### hardware requirement
1. Arduino UNO x 1
2. SG90 servo motor x 7 (per digit)
3. some peripherals

## Installation
1. based on the official github of [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) to set up the hardware (UNO board, upload Firmata, etc.)
2. use terminal to start the code
```zsh
cd Johnny-Five clock/
node strobe.js
```
